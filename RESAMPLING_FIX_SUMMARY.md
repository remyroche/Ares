# Resampling Fix Summary

## Issue Description

The system was encountering warnings during feature engineering when trying to resample volume-only data:

```
WARNING: Cannot resample data: missing required columns. Available: ['volume', 'volume_log', 'volume_detrended', 'volume_normalized']
```

## Root Cause

The `_resample_data_vectorized` function in `src/training/steps/vectorized_advanced_feature_engineering.py` was designed to handle:
1. OHLCV data (with columns: `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume`)
2. Trade data (with columns: `price`, `quantity`)

However, it was receiving volume-only data with columns like `volume`, `volume_log`, `volume_detrended`, `volume_normalized` and failing to handle this case properly.

## Solution

Enhanced the resampling logic to handle volume-only data by adding a new condition that:

1. **Detects volume-only data**: Checks if any column starts with 'volume'
2. **Applies appropriate aggregation**:
   - `volume` column: uses `sum` aggregation (appropriate for volume data)
   - `volume_*` derived features: uses `mean` aggregation (appropriate for derived metrics)
   - Other columns: uses `mean` aggregation as fallback

## Code Changes

Modified `src/training/steps/vectorized_advanced_feature_engineering.py` in the `_resample_data_vectorized` method:

```python
# Check if we have volume-only data (like volume features)
elif any(col.startswith('volume') for col in available_columns):
    # Handle volume-only data by resampling each volume column appropriately
    try:
        # Create aggregation dictionary for volume columns
        agg_dict = {}
        for col in available_columns:
            if col == 'volume':
                agg_dict[col] = 'sum'
            elif col.startswith('volume_'):
                # For derived volume features, use mean aggregation
                agg_dict[col] = 'mean'
            else:
                # For other columns, use mean
                agg_dict[col] = 'mean'
        
        resampled = data.resample(offset).agg(agg_dict)
        return resampled.dropna()
    except Exception as resample_error:
        self.logger.error(f"Error resampling volume data: {resample_error}")
        return data
```

## Testing

The fix was tested with various data types:
- ✅ Volume-only data: `['volume', 'volume_log', 'volume_detrended', 'volume_normalized']`
- ✅ OHLCV data: `['open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']`
- ✅ Trade data: `['price', 'quantity']`
- ✅ Mixed data: `['volume', 'volume_log', 'other_feature']`

## Impact

This fix eliminates the warning messages and allows the feature engineering pipeline to properly handle volume-only data during resampling operations, improving the robustness of the data processing pipeline.
