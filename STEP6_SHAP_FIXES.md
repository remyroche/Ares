# Step 6 SHAP Analysis Fixes

## Problem Summary

The Step 6 analyst enhancement was failing due to two main issues:

1. **Keras 3 Compatibility Issue**: 
   ```
   Warning: SHAP analysis failed: Your currently installed version of Keras is Keras 3, 
   but this is not yet supported in Transformers
   ```

2. **SHAP TreeExplainer Import Issue**:
   ```
   Error: module 'shap' has no attribute 'TreeExplainer'
   ```

## Root Causes

### 1. Keras 3 Compatibility
- The Transformers library doesn't yet support Keras 3
- The error occurs when SHAP tries to import TensorFlow/Keras components
- Solution: Install `tf-keras` for backwards compatibility

### 2. SHAP Import Structure Changes
- SHAP library structure has changed in recent versions
- `TreeExplainer` is not available in the expected location
- Multiple import paths need to be tried

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Keras Compatibility Fix

**File**: `fix_keras_compatibility.py`

This script automatically:
- Installs `tf-keras` for backwards compatibility
- Updates `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`
- Tests the compatibility fix

**Usage**:
```bash
python fix_keras_compatibility.py
```

**Manual Installation**:
```bash
pip install tf-keras>=2.15.0
```

### 2. Robust Feature Selection Implementation

**File**: `src/training/steps/step6_analyst_enhancement.py`

The updated Step 6 implements a multi-layered approach:

#### A. SHAP with Error Handling
```python
def _try_shap_feature_selection(self, model, model_name, ...):
    try:
        import shap
        # Try different SHAP explainer approaches
        if model_name in ["lightgbm", "xgboost", "random_forest"]:
            from shap.explainers import TreeExplainer
            # ... SHAP analysis
    except Exception as e:
        raise Exception(f"SHAP analysis failed: {e}")
```

#### B. Robust Fallback Methods
```python
def _robust_feature_selection(self, model, model_name, ...):
    # Method 1: Permutation Importance
    perm_importance = permutation_importance(model, X_val, y_val, ...)
    
    # Method 2: Model-specific importance
    if hasattr(model, 'feature_importances_'):
        model_importance = model.feature_importances_
    
    # Method 3: Statistical feature selection
    selector = SelectKBest(score_func=mutual_info_classif, ...)
    
    # Ensemble approach: combine all methods
    combined_scores = (perm_scores + model_importance + stat_scores) / 3
```

### 3. Comprehensive Error Handling

The new implementation includes:

- **Graceful degradation**: If SHAP fails, automatically falls back to robust methods
- **Multiple import paths**: Tries different SHAP import locations
- **Model-specific handling**: Different approaches for different model types
- **Safety bounds**: Ensures minimum and maximum feature counts

## Updated Dependencies

### requirements.txt
```txt
# ML/AI libraries
tensorflow>=2.15.0
keras>=2.15.0
tf-keras>=2.15.0  # Added for backwards compatibility
```

### pyproject.toml
```toml
# ML/AI libraries
tensorflow = "^2.15.0"
keras = "^2.15.0"
tf-keras = "^2.15.0"  # Added for backwards compatibility
```

## Testing

### Test Script
**File**: `test_step6_fixes.py`

This comprehensive test script verifies:
1. Keras compatibility fix
2. SHAP import and usage
3. Robust feature selection methods
4. Overall Step 6 functionality

**Usage**:
```bash
python test_step6_fixes.py
```

### Manual Testing
```python
# Test Keras compatibility
import tensorflow as tf
import tf_keras as keras
print(f"TensorFlow: {tf.__version__}")
print(f"Keras: {keras.__version__}")

# Test SHAP import
import shap
from shap.explainers import TreeExplainer
print("SHAP import successful")
```

## Feature Selection Methods

The updated Step 6 uses a hierarchical approach:

### 1. Primary: SHAP Analysis
- **TreeExplainer**: For tree-based models (LightGBM, XGBoost, Random Forest)
- **KernelExplainer**: For SVM models
- **Permutation Importance**: For neural networks

### 2. Fallback: Robust Ensemble
- **Permutation Importance**: Works for all model types
- **Model-specific importance**: Uses built-in feature importance
- **Statistical selection**: Mutual information-based selection
- **Ensemble combination**: Averages all methods for stability

### 3. Safety Features
- **Minimum features**: Keeps at least 10 features or 50% of original
- **Maximum features**: Limits to 20 features maximum
- **Error recovery**: Continues with all features if selection fails

## Configuration

### Feature Selection Bounds
```python
# Ensure we keep at least 10 features or 50% of original features
min_features = max(10, len(feature_names) // 2)
max_features = min(20, len(feature_names))  # Don't select more than 20 features
```

### Model-Specific Handling
```python
if model_name in ["lightgbm", "xgboost", "random_forest"]:
    # Use TreeExplainer for tree-based models
elif model_name == "svm":
    # Use KernelExplainer for SVM models
else:  # neural_network and others
    # Use permutation importance for non-tree models
```

## Logging and Monitoring

The updated implementation provides detailed logging:

```
🔄 Selecting optimal features using robust methods...
⚠️  SHAP analysis failed: Your currently installed version of Keras is Keras 3...
🔄 Trying alternative methods...
✅ Selected 15 optimal features using robust methods (from 25 total)
```

## Performance Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ SHAP analysis fails completely
- ❌ Feature selection falls back to all features
- ❌ No model optimization benefits

### After Fix
- ✅ SHAP works when available
- ✅ Robust fallback when SHAP fails
- ✅ Optimal feature selection achieved
- ✅ Model performance improvements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **tf-keras installation fails**
   ```bash
   pip install tf-keras==2.15.0
   ```

2. **SHAP still not working**
   - Check SHAP version: `pip show shap`
   - Try updating: `pip install --upgrade shap`

3. **Feature selection still using all features**
   - Check logs for specific error messages
   - Verify data quality and target diversity

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting the logger level:
```python
import logging
logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Projects

1. **Update dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install tf-keras>=2.15.0
   ```

2. **Update requirements files**:
   - Add `tf-keras>=2.15.0` to requirements.txt
   - Add `tf-keras = "^2.15.0"` to pyproject.toml

3. **Test the fixes**:
   ```bash
   python test_step6_fixes.py
   ```

4. **Run Step 6**:
   ```bash
   python -m src.training.steps.step6_analyst_enhancement
