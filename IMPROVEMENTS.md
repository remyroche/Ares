# Ares Trading Bot: Improvement & Enhancement List

This document tracks potential improvements and enhancements for the Ares Trading Bot project, across code quality, implementation, economics, and trading logic. Use this as a living roadmap for future development.

---

## 1. Code Quality
- [ ] **Consistent Type Annotations**: Ensure all functions and methods have explicit type hints, especially for public APIs.
- [ ] **Docstrings & Documentation**: Add/expand docstrings for all classes, methods, and modules. Generate Sphinx or MkDocs documentation.
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Increase unit and integration test coverage, especially for edge cases and error handling.
- [ ] **Remove Dead Code**: Use vulture and manual review to eliminate unused functions, classes, and imports.
- [ ] **Refactor Large Functions**: Further break down functions with high cyclomatic complexity (Radon D/E ratings).
- [ ] **Consistent Logging**: Standardize logging format and levels across all modules.
- [ ] **Error Handling Granularity**: Review and fine-tune error handler decorators for more granular fallback/recovery.
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: Pin all dependencies and add automated security/vulnerability checks.
- [ ] **Configuration Validation**: Add stricter validation and schema checks for config files and .env variables.
- [ ] **Automated Code Formatting**: Enforce ruff, black, isort, and shfmt in CI.

## 2. Code Implementation
- [ ] **Modularization**: Further decouple Analyst, Strategist, Tactician, and Supervisor for easier testing and extension.
- [ ] **Async/Await Consistency**: Ensure all I/O and network operations are fully async, and avoid blocking calls in async code.
- [ ] **Database Abstraction**: Abstract SQLite logic for easier migration to other databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, DuckDB).
- [ ] **State Management**: Centralize state transitions and persistence for robustness and crash recovery.
- [ ] **Event-Driven Architecture**: Consider using an event bus or message queue for inter-module communication.
- [ ] **Plugin System**: Allow custom strategies, indicators, or exchanges via a plugin interface.
- [ ] **Backtest/Live Parity**: Ensure all live trading logic is mirrored in backtesting for true strategy validation.
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize bottlenecks in data loading, feature engineering, and model inference.
- [ ] **Model Serialization**: Standardize model save/load formats and versioning.
- [ ] **API Rate Limit Handling**: Improve handling of exchange rate limits and adaptive retry logic.

## 3. Economics & Trading Logic
- [ ] **Advanced Risk Management**: Implement dynamic position sizing, Kelly criterion, and volatility targeting.
- [ ] **Transaction Cost Modeling**: Incorporate slippage, spread, and real exchange fees in both backtest and live.
- [ ] **Portfolio Optimization**: Add multi-asset portfolio management and optimization (e.g., mean-variance, risk parity).
- [ ] **Market Regime Detection**: Enhance regime classification with more features and unsupervised learning.
- [ ] **Alpha Decay Analysis**: Track and adapt to decaying model performance over time.
- [ ] **Order Execution Algorithms**: Add TWAP, VWAP, and iceberg order logic for large trades.
- [ ] **Signal Blending**: Combine multiple model outputs using meta-models or ensemble learning.
- [ ] **Walk-Forward & Out-of-Sample Validation**: Automate rolling walk-forward and OOS validation for all models.
- [ ] **A/B & Champion-Challenger Testing**: Systematically test new models/strategies against current champion.
- [ ] **Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts**: Add dashboards and alerting for drawdown, slippage, and model drift.

---

## 4. General/Other
- [ ] **User Interface**: Build a web dashboard for monitoring, configuration, and manual overrides.
- [ ] **Cloud/Distributed Support**: Enable distributed training and backtesting on cloud infrastructure.
- [ ] **Documentation & Tutorials**: Expand user/developer guides, add Jupyter notebooks for research workflows.
- [ ] **Community Contributions**: Add guidelines and templates for external contributors.
- [ ] **Regulatory Compliance**: Add modules for tax reporting, KYC/AML checks if needed.
