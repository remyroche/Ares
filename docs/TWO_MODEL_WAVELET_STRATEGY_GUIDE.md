# Two-Model Wavelet Strategy Guide

## Overview

This guide explains the sophisticated two-model strategy for implementing computationally-aware wavelet analysis in live trading. This approach ensures optimal feature selection while maintaining high prediction accuracy.

## The Problem

Traditional wavelet analysis generates hundreds of features, making it computationally expensive for live trading. We need a way to:
1. Identify the most predictive features
2. Maintain high accuracy
3. Achieve real-time performance
4. Deploy efficiently

## The Two-Model Solution

### Model #1: The Discovery Model

**Purpose**: Identify the most predictive features from the full feature set.

**Characteristics**:
- Trained on the complete, rich feature set (200+ features)
- Optimized for feature selection, not deployment
- Uses Random Forest with deep trees and many estimators
- Performs comprehensive feature importance analysis

**Process**:
1. Generate all possible wavelet features
2. Train Random Forest model on full dataset
3. Use SHAP and Permutation Importance for feature analysis
4. Rank features by importance and computation cost
5. Select top N features based on constraints

**Outcome**: List of "winner" features that are both predictive and computationally efficient.

### Model #2: The Production Model

**Purpose**: Deploy for live trading with optimal performance.

**Characteristics**:
- Trained only on the selected "winner" features
- Optimized for fast inference and deployment
- Uses Gradient Boosting with shallow trees
- Designed for real-time prediction

**Process**:
1. Create lean dataset with only winner features
2. Train new model from scratch on lean dataset
3. Validate performance against discovery model
4. Deploy with optimized configuration

**Outcome**: Fast, accurate model ready for live trading.

## Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Full Wavelet Analysis
```python
# Generate all possible wavelet features
features = await feature_engineer.engineer_features(price_data, volume_data)
# Result: 200+ features including DWT, CWT, packets, denoising, etc.
```

### Step 2: Train Discovery Model
```python
# Train Random Forest on full feature set
discovery_model = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=200,
    max_depth=15,
    random_state=42
)
discovery_model.fit(X_train_full, y_train)
# Purpose: Feature selection, not deployment
```

### Step 3: Feature Selection
```python
# Use SHAP and Permutation Importance
perm_importance = permutation_importance(discovery_model, X_test, y_test)
shap_values = shap.TreeExplainer(discovery_model).shap_values(X_test)

# Rank features by importance and cost
for feature in features:
    importance = calculate_combined_score(perm_importance, shap_values)
    cost = estimate_computation_cost(feature)
    rank_by_importance_cost_ratio(importance, cost)
```

### Step 4: Identify Winners
```python
# Select top features within computation constraints
winners = []
total_cost = 0
for feature in ranked_features:
    if total_cost + feature.cost <= max_computation_time:
        winners.append(feature)
        total_cost += feature.cost
    if len(winners) >= max_features:
        break
```

### Step 5: Create Lean Dataset
```python
# Extract only winner features
lean_features = {name: original_features[name] for name in winner_names}
lean_dataset = pd.DataFrame(lean_features)
# Result: Dataset with only 10-20 most important features
```

### Step 6: Train Production Model
```python
# Train new model on lean dataset
production_model = GradientBoostingClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    max_depth=6,
    learning_rate=0.1
)
production_model.fit(X_train_lean, y_train)
# Purpose: Fast, accurate deployment
```

### Step 7: Deploy Optimized Configuration
```python
# Create live configuration with only winner features
live_config = {
    "selected_features": winner_names,
    "model_path": "production_model.pkl",
    "max_computation_time": 0.1,
    "feature_weights": winner_weights
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Discovery Model Configuration
```yaml
discovery_model:
  type: "random_forest"
  n_estimators: 200
  max_depth: 15
  min_samples_split: 5
  min_samples_leaf: 2
  # Optimized for feature selection
```

### Production Model Configuration
```yaml
production_model:
  type: "gradient_boosting"
  n_estimators: 100
  max_depth: 6
  learning_rate: 0.1
  subsample: 0.8
  # Optimized for deployment
```

### Feature Selection Criteria
```python
def select_winners(features, max_time=0.1, max_features=20):
    winners = []
    total_cost = 0
    
    for feature in sorted(features, key=lambda x: x.importance_score, reverse=True):
        if (total_cost + feature.computation_cost <= max_time * 1000 and 
            len(winners) < max_features):
            winners.append(feature)
            total_cost += feature.computation_cost
    
    return winners
```

## Deployment Strategy

### 1. Model Files
- `production_model.pkl`: Trained production model
- `production_features.json`: List of winner feature names
- `live_config.yaml`: Optimized live trading configuration

### 2. Integration
```python
# Load production model
with open("production_model.pkl", "rb") as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Load feature names
with open("production_features.json", "r") as f:
    feature_names = json.load(f)

# Extract only winner features
lean_features = extract_features(data, feature_names)
prediction = model.predict(lean_features)
```

### 3. Monitoring
```python
# Track performance
performance_metrics = {
    "accuracy": current_accuracy,
    "computation_time": avg_computation_time,
    "feature_count": len(active_features),
    "accuracy_preservation": current_acc / discovery_acc
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Retraining
- Retrain discovery model monthly
- Update winner features quarterly
- Monitor performance continuously

### 2. Feature Validation
- Validate feature availability before deployment
- Check computation costs in production
- Monitor feature importance drift

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Track accuracy preservation
- Monitor computation time
- Alert on performance degradation

### 4. Fallback Strategy
- Keep discovery model as backup
- Implement graceful degradation
- Have alternative feature sets ready

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Low Accuracy Preservation
**Problem**: Production model accuracy much lower than discovery model
**Solution**: 
- Increase number of winner features
- Adjust feature selection criteria
- Retrain with different model parameters

#### 2. High Computation Time
**Problem**: Still exceeding time limits
**Solution**:
- Reduce number of winner features
- Optimize feature computation
- Use more efficient algorithms

#### 3. Feature Drift
**Problem**: Winner features become less important over time
**Solution**:
- Retrain discovery model more frequently
- Update winner features regularly
- Monitor feature importance trends

### Performance Tuning

#### 1. Feature Selection Tuning
```python
# Adjust thresholds
min_importance_threshold = 0.005  # Lower threshold
max_computation_time = 0.15      # Increase time limit
top_n_features = 25              # More features
```

#### 2. Model Tuning
```python
# Discovery model - more thorough
discovery_model = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=300,  # More trees
    max_depth=20,      # Deeper trees
    min_samples_split=3
)

# Production model - faster inference
production_model = GradientBoostingClassifier(
    n_estimators=50,   # Fewer trees
    max_depth=4,       # Shallower trees
    learning_rate=0.2  # Higher learning rate
)
```

## Conclusion

The two-model strategy provides the optimal balance between:
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Discovery model finds all important features
- **Efficient Deployment**: Production model uses only the best features
- **Performance Preservation**: Maintains high accuracy while reducing computation
- **Scalability**: Easy to retrain and update

This approach ensures that live trading systems can leverage the full power of wavelet analysis while meeting strict real-time performance requirements.
