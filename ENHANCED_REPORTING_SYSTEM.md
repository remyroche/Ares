    side="buy",
    quantity=1.0,
    price=2000.0,
    timestamp=datetime.now(),
    trade_metadata=trade_metadata,
)

# Get performance metrics
metrics = launcher.get_performance_metrics()
print(f"Total PnL: ${metrics['total_pnl']:.2f}")

# Generate comprehensive report
report = await launcher.generate_comprehensive_report("comprehensive")
```

```python
# Launch backtest with same detailed metrics
results = await launcher.launch_backtest(
    historical_data=historical_data,
    strategy_signals=strategy_signals,
